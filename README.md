# Find the duck game

This game is inspired by our summer students in 2024. The idea is to be social with the people we *probably* don't know and *probably* will never get to know. A kind of being social without really needing to interact with anyone. Isn't it amazing you sweet introvert? :)

### How to play
1. Scan the QR code
2. Write your name and the date
3. Hide the duck for the next person
